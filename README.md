## Implemented Effects

- **Robotic Voice**  
  Applied amplitude modulation and spectral shaping techniques to synthesize a mechanical, metallic voice texture.

- **Dark Phonk**  
  Designed deep bass enhancement, intentional distortion, and selective frequency filtering to recreate the dark, gritty soundscape characteristic of the Phonk music genre.

- **Walkie Talkie Effect**  
  Simulated narrow-band communication audio by applying band-pass filtering and dynamic range compression to mimic traditional walkie-talkie sound characteristics.

- **3D Audio Effect**  
  Created spatial audio perception by manipulating interaural time differences (ITD) and amplitude panning, providing an immersive stereo experience.

## Tools and Skills

- **Platform**: TMS320C6416T DSP Starter Kit (DSK6416T)
- **Software**: Code Composer Studio (CCS)
- **Techniques**:
  - Real-time fixed-point DSP programming
  - Audio codec configuration and control
  - Real-time signal path optimization
  - Algorithm design for audio effects


## Future Improvements

- Adding more effects like pitch shifting, reverb, and chorus
- Porting algorithms to floating-point DSPs
- Optimizing memory and execution cycle usage for larger effect chains
