We implemented real-time audio effects using the TMS320C6416T DSP platform and Code Composer Studio. This project focused on designing and optimizing digital signal processing algorithms to create various audio effects in real-time.

Implemented Effects:
Robotic Voice:
Applied amplitude modulation and spectral shaping techniques to synthesize a mechanical, metallic voice texture.

Dark Phonk:
Designed deep bass enhancement, intentional distortion, and selective frequency filtering to recreate the dark, gritty soundscape characteristic of the Phonk music genre.

Walkie Talkie Effect:
Simulated narrow-band communication audio by applying band-pass filtering and dynamic range compression to mimic traditional walkie-talkie sound characteristics.

3D Audio Effect:
Created spatial audio perception by manipulating interaural time differences (ITD) and amplitude panning, providing an immersive stereo experience.

Tools and Skills:
Platform: TMS320C6416T DSP Starter Kit (DSK6416T)

Software: Code Composer Studio (CCS)

Techniques:
