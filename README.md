Implemented real-time audio effects using the TMS320C6416T DSP platform and Code Composer Studio. Developed and optimized algorithms to create diverse effects such as: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Robotic Voice}: Applied amplitude modulation and spectral shaping to synthesize a mechanical vocal quality. \item \textbf{Dark Phonk}: Introduced deep bass enhancement, distortion, and filtering to mimic the dark, gritty textures of the Phonk music genre. \item \textbf{Walkie Talkie Effect}: Simulated narrow-band communication audio by applying band-pass filtering and dynamic range compression. \item \textbf{3D Audio Effect}: Created spatialization by manipulating interaural time differences (ITD) and amplitude panning for immersive stereo output. \end{itemize} Gained hands-on experience in fixed-point DSP programming, real-time signal path optimization, and audio codec configuration.# VibeShift
